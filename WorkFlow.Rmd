This is where we'll put the principles for writing content files for this site.

1. Everything in markdown -> HTML
2. Front matter

## Directories:
Jekyll – use for website development
Rebekah – use for my own stuff
Something new – for official website

## Categories: 
  Items from levels 1 and 2 (multiple are encouraged)


## WEBSITE MATERIALS

Blogs -> events (will go on front page)

### Level 1:

Instructions (for compiling) {Everything will come in RMD and be easily transitioned to HTML or PDF}

* Statistics
    * one 
    * two
* Calculus
* Modeling
	
### Level 2:

Instances of each of the following for each of stats, calc, modeling. Level 3 will be sub-categories in each one.

Class notes (lesson plans, instructor notes, tips, tricks, examples, lecture notes, etc.

Assessments (homework, exams, quizzes)

Handouts (instructional handouts, activities, etc.)

Projects & Labs (part of assessments and/or handouts

Workshop materials

Syllabi and Resources (syllabi examples, links to web content, data, etc.)
